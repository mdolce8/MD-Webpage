<h3 id="about-me">About Me</h3>
<p style="text-align: left">
    I am a PhD student studying experimental high energy neutrino physics at Tufts University.
    <br> <br>
    I received my B.S. in physics from the University at Albany in 2017.
    During my time, I worked with <a href="https://www.albany.edu/physics/faculty/vivek-jain"> Vivek Jain </a> on the ATLAS detector at CERN.
    <br> <br>

    In 2020, I received my M.S. in Physics at Tufts University.
    <br><br>
    My thesis work is within the <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/nutufts/about/">Tufts High Energy Physics group</a>, under my advisor Professor Hugh Gallagher,
    to measure neutrino oscillation parameters with data from the NOvA experiment.
    Currently, I am funded by the Universities Research Association (URA) <a href="https://www.ura-hq.org/awards/visiting-scholars-program/">Visiting Scholars Program (VSP)</a>
    for graduate students and faculty to study at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, the location of the NOvA experiment.

    My thesis research is to use Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) -- a Bayesian inference tool --
    with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo on the <a href="https://novaexperiment.fnal.gov/">NOvA</a> Near and Far Detector data to
    obtain best fit values for the parameters that govern neutrino oscillation.

<h3 id="binding-energy"> Nuclear Binding Energy </h3>
<p>
    In neutrino interactions, neutrinos commonly interact with a single proton/neutron rather than the whole nucleus.
    However, because protons/neutrons (also known as a nucleon) live within a nucleus, a nucleon that is observed by a detector has
        overcome some "potential" energy to exit the nucleus from which it was bound.
    This energy is so critical because in neutrino experiments, in order to measure the  parameters that govern its oscillation,
        we must reconstruct the neutrino's energy as precisely as possible.
    This includes the nuclear binding energy since this energy lost to the nucleus originated from the neutrino.
    This potential energy is currently impossible to directly measure and is often called the <b>nuclear binding energy</b>.
    Therefore, various models have been proposed to account for this energy (sometimes also called the removal energy).
    My work involved was to incorporate a specific binding energy physics model into the NOvA experiment's simulation and
        determine the impact of the model on NOvA's prediction.

    <!-- include the image I gave for FSI talk -->
    Also within the nucleus is a phenomenon called Final State Interactions (FSI).
    When a neutrino interacts with a neutron inside the nucleus, a proton is created and in some cases produces a pion.
        This pion must also traverse the nuclear medium before it can be observed in our detectors.
    However, there a number of interactions a pion can experience before we can observe it.
    For example, the pion can be absorbed into the nucleus, and therefore is never observed in our detector.
    In this case, the estimate for the true neutrino energy would be missing the contribution of energy from the pion,
        further hindering a reasonable estimate of the true neutrino energy (similar to the binding energy), and
        therefore preventing a precise measurement of the neutrino oscillation parameters.
    To improve NOvA's simulation, I have tuned an existing FSI physics model to form better agreement with external data.
    By improving this FSI model, NOvA can more accurately predict when such a FSI interaction occurs, such as the example
    of an absorbed pion in the nucleus, thereby improving NOvA's simulation to predict neutrino energies and their interactions.

    <p> During my second summer at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), I worked on the neutrino experiment MicroBooNE
        based at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. This experiment uses the new
        technology of Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC). The use of such material for a detector
