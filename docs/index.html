<h3 id="about-me">About Me</h3>
<p style="text-align: left">
    I am a PhD student studying experimental high energy neutrino physics at Tufts University.
    <br> <br>
    I received my B.S. in physics from the University at Albany in 2017.
    During my time, I worked with <a href="https://www.albany.edu/physics/faculty/vivek-jain"> Vivek Jain </a> on the ATLAS detector at CERN.
    <br> <br>

    In 2020, I received my M.S. in Physics at Tufts University.
    <br><br>
    My thesis work is within the <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/nutufts/about/">Tufts High Energy Physics group</a>, under my advisor Professor Hugh Gallagher,
    to measure neutrino oscillation parameters with data from the NOvA experiment.
    Currently, I am funded by the Universities Research Association (URA) <a href="https://www.ura-hq.org/awards/visiting-scholars-program/">Visiting Scholars Program (VSP)</a>
    for graduate students and faculty to study at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, the location of the NOvA experiment.

<h3 id="phd-work"> PhD Thesis Research </h3>
<p>
    My thesis research is to use Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) -- a Bayesian inference tool --
    with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo on the <a href="https://novaexperiment.fnal.gov/">NOvA</a> Near and Far Detector data to
    obtain best fit values for the parameters that govern neutrino oscillation.

<h3 id="binding-energy"> Nuclear Binding Energy </h3>
<p>
    In neutrino interactions, neutrinos commonly interact with a single proton/neutron rather than the whole nucleus.
    However, because protons/neutrons (i.e. a nucleon) live within a nucleus, a nucleon that is observed by a detector has
        overcome some "potential" energy to exit the nucleus from which it was bound -- often called the <b>nuclear binding energy</b>.
    This energy is critical in neutrino experiments because in order to measure the parameters that govern its oscillation,
        we must reconstruct the neutrino's energy as precisely as possible.
    This includes the nuclear binding energy since this energy lost to the nucleus originated from the neutrino.
    This potential energy is very difficult to directly measure and various models have been proposed to correctly account for this energy (sometimes also called the removal energy).
    My work involved was to incorporate a specific binding energy physics model into the NOvA experiment's simulation and
        determine the impact of the model on NOvA's prediction.

<h3 id="hN-FSI"> hN FSI model tuning and uncertainties </h3>
<p>
    <!-- include the image I gave for FSI talk -->
    Also within the nucleus is a phenomenon called Final State Interactions (FSI).
    When a neutrino interacts with a neutron inside the nucleus, a proton is created and in some cases produces a pion.
        This pion must also traverse the nuclear medium before it can be observed in our detectors.
    However, there a number of interactions a pion can experience before we can observe it.
    For example, the pion can be absorbed into the nucleus, and therefore is never observed in our detector.
    In this case, the estimate for the true neutrino energy would be missing the contribution of energy from the pion,
        further hindering a reasonable estimate of the true neutrino energy (similar to the binding energy), and
        therefore preventing a precise measurement of the neutrino oscillation parameters.
    To improve NOvA's simulation, I have tuned an existing FSI physics model to form better agreement with external data.
    By improving this FSI model, NOvA can more accurately predict when such a FSI interaction occurs, such as the example
    of an absorbed pion in the nucleus, thereby improving NOvA's simulation to predict neutrino energies and their interactions.

<h3 id="uboone-study"> Signal processing of MicroBooNE detector </h3>

<!--<div style="clear: left"><p style="float: left;"><img src="uboone.jpeg" height="180px" width="180px" border="1px" alt="uboone-image"></p>-->
    <p> The MicroBooNE neutrino experiment uses a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) detector
            to provide high resolution reconstruction of particle interactions.
        In this LArTPC, there is a single anode wire plane with a voltage applied that collects charges from interacting particles.
        In this study, data was collected of various anode voltage configurations and I identified which voltage configuration
            produced the strongest signal from background noise
            by measuring the charge deposited from tracks in a series of different orientations.

<!--        Data was collected for various voltage strengths of the anode plane to produce the study.-->

<h3 id="#nutau-optimization"> Optimization of tau neutrinos in DUNE </h3>
<p>
    The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), is the neutrino experiment of
    the future.
    It will not begin taking data for a few more years. However, there are many studies that
        can be done before data-taking begins. For example, to understand how to
    optimize the appearance of tau neutrinos in the DUNE Far Detectors.
    My study sought to understand this question by analyzing configurations of the
    target complex at the Long Baseline Neutrino Facitilty (LBNF) in Fermilab, the source
    of the neutrino beam.

<h2> Academic Involvement </h2>

<hr class="lineThinBlue">

<h3> Physics Education Research Literature </h3>
<p>
    Physics education research (PER) is a growing subfield in the physics and academic community. At Tufts University, the physics
    department is actively engaged in this sector. As a teaching assistant (TA) for introductory physics courses, we read the foundational reports and studies
    on physics education (cite) and discuss how we can implement changes in our intro courses.

    In addition, Tufts is a member of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Listening Project (cite), which seeks to improve student
    retention rate in the introductory STEM courses. Here we engage in examples of student learning to improve as instructors
    to better understand student thinking and better improve instructor listening of student ideas.

    As one study reports (cite), the idea that students have a fixed mindset is not the correct approach, learning is a growth process and
    it should be understood that all students are further along in their growth than others.
